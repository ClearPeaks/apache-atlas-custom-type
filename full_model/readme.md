# Defining custom types in Apache Atlas

## Excel Model Example

This folder contains all the artifacts to create the final model in Apache Atlas. We have 3 files, which we need to run in sequence to form a model in our Atlas. Sequence can be identified from the `name` of the file itself.

```bash
1 - basic_entities.json
2 - worksheet.json
3 - Full Template with Relations.json
```
